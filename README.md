Predicting NHL Player Salary using Multiple Linear Regression - STAT 1341

Project for Stat 1341. Conducted literature review on predictive sports models to design, hypothesize, and test a linear regression model to predict NHL player salary and better understand what features (predictors) go into an NHL players salary.

-Scraped and merged data from multiple sources and conducted exploratory data analysis looking at some of the features descriptive statistics.
-Performed feature engineering to create new variables, specifically converting count variables to rate variables and performing a log transformation on salary to help normalize data.
-Utilized stepwise model selection to test multiple models and minimize our final model's Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
-Reviewed model performance and performed residual anaylsis.

-Looking to add on to the depth of this model in the future. While the model was > 99% significant, there is still a lot of variation to be explained and a better understand to be had of player salary and how that directly relates to player performance.
